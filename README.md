# Restaurant Revenue Prediction 

As part of a course final project, I cleaned and analyzed a set of dataset(s), both the training set and the test set, that contained restaurant information used to predict the potential revenue through a linear regression. 

Beginning with the information provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/data), the training set was explored to see what kind of insights were provided.

Pointing to the data to be pretty much localized to the Turkey region, I went ahead and went a little deeper in the exploration to see if there were any interesting insights that could be unraveled.
